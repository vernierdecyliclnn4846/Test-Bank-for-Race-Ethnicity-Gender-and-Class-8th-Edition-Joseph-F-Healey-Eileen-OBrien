  * * Author: Joseph F. Healey, Eileen O’Brien
   
  * Known for its clear and engaging writing, the bestselling Race, Ethnicity, Gender, and Class by Joseph F. Healey, Andi Stepnick, and Eileen O’Brien has been thoroughly updated to make it fresher, more relevant, and more accessible to undergraduates. The Eighth Edition retains the same use of sociological theory to tell the story of race and other socially constructed inequalities in the U.S. and for examining the variety of experiences within each minority group, particularly differences between those of men and women. This edition also puts greater emphasis on intersectionality, gender, and sexual orientation that will offer students a deeper understanding of diversity.
